This is a code example for a simple Angular 2 frontend using static JSON as mocked data that could be returned by an API.

## Installation

Clone this git repo to your local machine.

Run `npm install` to download dependencies. (NOTE: You must have node >= 6.9.1 for angular-cli to work.)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
